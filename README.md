- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Paulo Bissonho. I am a game developer and Flutter enthusiast with an entrepreneurial spirit. I have a strong passion for programming and have been working on personal projects since 2015. To date, I have released five games on Steam, the world's largest gaming platform, and have developed a complete flight simulation system for Second Life. In addition to my technical skills, I have practical experience using Scrum and working effectively in teams. Overall, I love to play with code and am dedicated to creating high-quality gaming experiences


## The beginning
- This video represents the culmination of over 300 hours of hard work and over 10,000 lines of code. It's the result of my love for programming and represents the beginning of my journey as a developer. I hope you enjoy it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFOWbPuTMBs&ab_channel=TVDefesaSL
